# Zaxxon game
Trying to do a 3D version of classic game Zaxxon

This is my first video game after completing Godot tutorials: [Your First 2D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) and [Your First 3D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html) with the help and suport of the Rafa Lagoon Community:
